            <p>I was born in Doha, Qatar. Doha is known for being the headquarters of Al Jazeera News, and not much else! Me and my older brother were both born there. My parents were part of the "Brain Drain" of Sudan in the 90's. When Omar Al-Bashir's ethnofascist regime started, any progressive minded person who had any ability to leave, left. My dad was a Marxist, so we were very much GONE.</p>
            <img src="bb2.jpg" alt="Me and my brother in my only baby picture" width="500" height="300">

            <p>When I was 9 months old, my family moved to the United States. I became a naturalized U.S. citizen when I was 12 years old. Unfortunately I do not have dual citizenship, so I'm stuck here. Hooray! It's cool, though. There's been war and infighting in Sudan for the entire 28 years that I've been alive anyway. I'm not missing much. I have family who has been tortured by the government there, most notably a diabetic third cousin who was falsely imprisoned, starved, and deprived of his insulin. He died. Not missing much, for real!</p>
            <p>After immigrating to the U.S. as political refugees, we landed in Phoenixville, PA and then spent a short time in Westchester, PA; home of Bam Margera (though I didn't know he was from there until very recently).</p>
        
            <img src="vlb.jpg" alt="Viva la Bam crew" width="200" height="150">

            <p>Viva la Bam was one of my favorite TV shows growing up, and fundamentally altered my brain chemistry (for the worse). My parents both worked constantly to support our extended family in Sudan, and for YEARS I only ever saw them eating, or sleeping. They worked long hours and tolerated a lot of mistreatment just to provide for us.</p>

            <p>My family moved to Chicago when I was 3. I <i>begged</i> them let me to go to school, so they lied about my age and I started kindergarten at 5.</p>
            <p> I got bullied a LOT. For being a geek, for being "too quiet," for being darkskinned, for being African, and especially for being Muslim (although I no longer identify with Islam). If you know anything about American history circa 2003-2011, you'll know that any Muslim or brown-looking person during that time ran the risk of being labeled a terrorist, or much worse. It was quite possibly the most popular joke of the era, although not as bad as being sent to Abu Ghraib. That was something we heard a lot at school, so I really leaned on my big brother to be my only friend. The first (and last) fight I got into was defending him from 5th grader bullies when I was in 2nd grade. They dislocated my shoulder, and I quickly found out that violence is actually not the answer! We protected each other pretty well, until puberty happened and the misogyny brainrot began. We were divided, and conquered. <i>Sigh</i>.</p>
            
            <img src="bb1.jpg" alt="A photo of my brother and I when we were kids." width="500" height="300">

            <p>I was going to Walt Disney Magnet School from 1st to 3rd grade, and I was lucky enough to have very sophisticated computer, music, science, and art classes there. Most of the teachers in those classes were Black, which gave me clear role models who looked like me and supported me to pursue my interests. My home life was really difficult, so I leaned on my teachers to be the trusted adults in my life. They saw me as a precocious kid who was desperate for someone to care about me, and I was lucky enough that a lot of them did. NOT ALL, but enough that being at school was my favorite time of the day. At school I was safe, fed (thank you CPS free meal program), and as long as I did the work I wouldn't be screamed at or beaten. It was my sanctuary.</p>
            <p>I was a huge fan of computer class. My friends and I would compete in Mavis Beacon (anybody remember her?) and spend hours making terrible drawings in KidPix. I joined the computer club when I was around 5th grade, and I learned how to take apart and put together an old donated Dell PC from scratch. I also got to take it home, and it was the "home computer" at my dad's house for the rest of my childhood. I'd spend hours on mySpace chatting with my friends, and I discovered community through MMORPGs like RuneScape and Maplestory. My brother had full dominion over the console games we had, so I used what was available to me and made the best of it. That's still kind of all I ever do, to this day.</p>
            <p>My mom worked day and night to get certified to practice medicine in the U.S. She was a doctor in Sudan, but she had to start all over here. Even with all her training, she was cleaning bedpans and giving sponge baths as a CNA. She never let anyone make her feel less than, and instilled in me the importance of knowing who you are and where you come from. She always told me:</p>

            <p>From all the madness of this journey, there are a few things I learned that have gotten me through it. I'd like to share them with you:</p>
            
            <p>1. THERAPY! THERAPY! THERAPY! I come from a culture where mental health isn't considered a real thing. I had to learn the hard way how important it was to heal from my traumas in order to be successful. My therapist is my BBFL.</p>
            <p>2. Don't be afraid to cut someone off. If they're dead weight in your life, and consistently causing you pain, you won't believe how much lighter life could actually be until you experience it.</p>
            <p>3. Trust yourself. Nobody can tell you what it's like to walk in your shoes.</p>
            <p>4. Be honest! It doesn't mean you have to tell everyone everything, but at least be honest with yourself. And with your therapist, if you have one.</p>
            <p>5. Dream, dream, dream. Sometimes having the dream is enough, even if you don't think you'll get there. Do what you can and you'll never believe where you end up.</p>
